        <h4>"{{ site.author }} is a musician and composer with a rather unique approach to his sound and releases. What I love about his tracks is that they are beautifully cinematic. They don’t need lyrics in order to tell a compelling story..."</h4>
        <h4>"As a prolific composer, {{ site.author }} is a master at channeling a wide variety of musical influences, but in such a way the the sound never feels like a trite re-composition of some other artists' music, but rather something quite original, as a labour of love and passion for the music itself."</h4>
        <p>{{ site.author }} began learning piano at 8 years old. In late high school, {{ site.author }} discovered rock music and became a prolific arranger, guitarist, bass player, and composer.</p>
        <p>During his college years, {{ site.author }} played in many local bands, while also writing, recording and producing two highly-acclaimed instrumental genre-bending rock albums.</p>
        <p>After college, {{ site.author }} drifted away from the musical world, as programming and video game development becoming time-consuming passions. Along the way, {{ site.author }} developed a deep love for minimalism and rich emotional experiences.</p>
        <p><b>To Arcadia</b> is a work inspired by beauty and emotional richness, brought to bear with heartfelt minimalist piano compositions, and soul-lifting art.</p>
